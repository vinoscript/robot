# 20 - Special Weapon (Bonus)
# Introduce the concept of a special weapon which is like a 
# grenade but with a range of 1. However, in addition to being 
# targetted at a specific robot, this one-time use weapon damages 
# all robots surrounding the target. Its damage goes straight 
# through shields (if you implemented shields) and directly 
# reduces their health by 30 points.
