# 15 - Introduce Shields
# Robots can start with 50 shield points. When the robot is damaged 
# it first drains the shield and then starts affecting actual health.

# You will likely also have to fix previous tests that will fail 
# due to this enhancement. However, focus on running spec 16 until 
# you are done, then rerun all your tests to find other failing 
# tests and modify the tests to modify their expectations.
